## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Select whether they want to use metric or imperial units
- Enter their height and weight
- See their BMI result, with their weight classification and healthy weight range
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass (Preprocessor) for CSS [https://sass-lang.com/]
- Scss syntax
- Javascript for interactivity

### What I learned

This challenge helped me a lot especially on the Javascript part, therefore in the fundamental code that is used to make the form work in which to calculate one's BMI, which is the central part of the challenge itself;

It was not easy to immediately understand all the logic necessary to make everything work, including managing the stylization of the two types of input present, and in general, the stylization of the form in all its parts.

But thanks to this work, which has helped me to practice on the site's design structure, it has led me to have more awareness in managing the "interactive" side, in this case collecting user data and presenting a result after due calculations.

### Continued development

For now, I want to keep my main focus on continuous training and improvement of Javascript, because it's the weakest part of various front-end languages.
So I will continue to create challenges of this type to better understand the logic and JS dynamics behind each site feature.

## Acknowledgments

Precisely because of the difficulties I encountered in carrying out this challenge, as I wrote before, especially regarding Javascript, at a certain point I had to look for some solution created by some other Frontent Mentor user, which turned out to be absolutely fundamental.

The crucial point that was difficult for me to solve was in dealing with the data provided by the user in the version of the Imperial system and making the necessary conversions to be able to work more simply;
I really enjoyed @Chris-2811's solution where I looked through the JS code and made the necessary improvements in my project.
